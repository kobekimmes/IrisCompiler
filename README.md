**Iris Compiler**

This is a toy-project I am working on to get a better understanding of what happens behind the scenes after you "press the play button" or compule your code.

Written in C

My dog Iris is the eponym for this project 

**Example Syntax**

// Single line comments
function f_name(type var1, type var2) -> return_type {
    return ...
}

An example of this being used;

// This function returns the sum of two numbers
function sum(num a, num b) -> num {
    num c = a + b;
    return c;
}

This language is designed to model C and be an introduction to programming for new developers.
